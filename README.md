### JosÃ© Fernando HÃ¶wer Barbosa - Fullstack Software Engineer
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Colombian-Austrian based in Vienna, passionate about programming.

I studied Bachelor of Music in Colombia, and I have a background as a teacher of students of different ages.

After taking the opportunity to learn programing I have managed not only to direct my professional path towards something that makes me feel fulfilled and happy but also to be able to help others with my daily work.
